Portable EXE Generator is software that is made by using  `Python`  and the GUI library  `Tkinter`.

## How it Works?

It uses the [Winrar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) self-extraction mechanism to make a single portable executable file of any installed software on your Windows machine.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alert
It may or may not work for those folders which require administration privileges for accessing, like folders of `C:/` drive in windows.
